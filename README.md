# pascal.vim

This is a fork of [vim-colors-plain][] which is being developed based on my
personal taste.

## Motivation

Minimalistic colorscheme which uses bold to highlight keywords and a
distinguished color for constant literals (string, numbers, JSX tags).

<!-- TODO #1 Add screenshots -->

## Installation & Usage

With [vim-plug][] you add this to the `.vimrc`:

```Vim
Plug 'crispybaccoon/pascal.vim'
```

Then:

```Vim
set background=light " Set to dark for a dark variant
colorscheme plain
```
